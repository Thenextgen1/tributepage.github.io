      <ul>
        <li><strong>1956</strong> - Born in Lagos</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - Mainland Primary School Yaba</li>
        <li><strong>1968</strong> - Corona high-school Yaba</li>
        <li><strong>1969</strong> - Attended Queen's School Ibadan for her secondary school education</li>
        <li><strong>1981</strong> - Graduates from the University of Lagos and goes on to serve her mandatory house-manship at LUTH</li>
        <li><strong>2012</strong> - First to alert the Nigeria Ministry of Health when the swine flu(H1N1) spread to the country </li>
        <li><strong>2014</strong> - Successfully diagnosed Liberian Patrick Sawyer of Ebola at First Consultant Hospital in Lagos</li>
        <p> Dr. Adadevoh also kept Patrick Sawyer at the hospital despite receiving a request from the Liberian ambassador to release him. Dr. Adadevoh tried to create an isolation area, despite the lack of protective equipment, by raising a wooden barricade outside Patrick Sawyer's door. Her heroic effort saved the nation from widespread infection. At the time of these events, Nigerian doctors were on strike, which could have led to severe crises.[16] The professionalism and thorough medical examination carried out by Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh was impeccable. Adadevoh also provided staff with relevant information about the virus, procured protective gear and quickly contacted relevant officials. As a result of her report, the Nigerian government declared a national public health emergency and the Nigerian Ministry of Health set up an Ebola Emergency Operations Center. WHO declared Nigeria to be Ebola-free on October 20, 2014.</p>
